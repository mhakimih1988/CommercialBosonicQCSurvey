    "## Using Remote Backend Simulators and QPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a local simulator with the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "simulator = pcvl.Simulator(pcvl.NaiveBackend())\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, to leverage backend simulators and real quantum processing units (QPUs), we will switch to using remote processors in the following cells. This is done by initializing the simulator as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "simulator = pcvl.RemoteProcessor(\"sim:slos\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, \"sim:slos\" refers to a specific backend simulator named slos. You can replace \"sim:slos\" with the name of any other available backend simulator or QPU accessible from your Quandela dashboard to run your experiments on different hardware or simulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: To submit jobs to remote backends, you need to generate an access token from your profile on the Quandela website.\n",
    "Then, add the token to your code using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pcvl.RemoteConfig.set_token(\"<your_token_here>\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Replace <your_token_here> with your actual token string to authenticate your requests.\n"
